The assignment spec can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAuMONAOc2DatPa_JaAFdnbrGhZQ5ZyMk8bKgRMvSQY/)

## Prerequisites
- Node
- Npm

## Installation Overview

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the Node.js® web site.

#### Installation Steps

 - Download the Windows installer from [Nodes.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
 - Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
 - Follow the prompts in the installer.
 - Restart your computer.


#### Test it!

Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

*Test Node:*
Open Command Prompt and type node -v. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.

*Test Npm:*
Open Command Prompt and type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28


### Use the repo
1. Download it
2. Open using an IDE (We are using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)) 
3. Run `npm install` (You can do this either in the terminal or by double-clicking the task in the npm tool window in WebStorm.)
4. Run `npm start` to get the app running in the development mode.
5. Wait till the app is compiled and the Webpack dev server is ready
6. Open it `http://localhost:3000/`
